Prerequisites
------------
- GCC
- Python
- OpenSSL
- Qt Open Source Edition (optional; not needed for Swiften)

Building

  setup:
		qt = "path/to/qt"
	(e.g. qt = "/usr/share/qt4")
- Run 
		./scons
- To build only a subdir, add the path as a target to scons. E.g., for Swift:
		./scons Swift

Running tests
-------------
- Run
		./scons test=unit
	for running the unit tests.
